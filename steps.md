Initialization:

- Population Creation: Generate an initial population of potential solutions (chromosomes or individuals). Each solution is represented by a set of parameters known as genes.
- Randomization: Initialize the values of genes in each individual randomly or using some predefined strategy.

Selection:
- Fitness Evaluation: Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population. The fitness function measures how well an individual solves the given problem.
- Selection Operator: Select individuals from the current population to form a new population for the next generation. Higher fitness individuals are more likely to be selected, but the process may include some element of randomness.

Crossover (Recombination):
- Crossover Operator: Perform crossover (also known as recombination or mating) on pairs of selected individuals. This involves exchanging genetic information between two individuals to create new offspring.
- Recombination Rate: The probability that crossover will be applied to a pair of individuals.

Mutation:
- Mutation Operator: Apply mutation to some individuals in the new population. Mutation introduces small random changes to the genes of individuals to maintain diversity.
- Mutation Rate: The probability that mutation will be applied to an individual.

Replacement:
- Replace Old Population: Create a new population for the next generation by combining individuals from the current population, including offspring from crossover and mutation.
- Elitism: Optionally, retain some of the best individuals (based on fitness) from the previous generation to ensure the best solutions are not lost.

Termination:
- Convergence Check: Check for termination conditions, such as achieving a satisfactory solution, reaching a specified number of generations, or running out of computational resources.
- The algorithm then iterates through the selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement phases until a termination condition is met. The result is a population of solutions that should perform well according to the defined fitness function.
